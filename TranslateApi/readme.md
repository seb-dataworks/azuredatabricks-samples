Example notebook on how to use Azure Databricks together with the Azure Translate API and Azure Data Lake Store.

What you need:
- Python 3
- Azure Databricks (although this should probably work with small modifications from other Python runtime as well)
- Azure Translate API subscription key (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/)
- Azure Data Lake Store (or modify the notebook and put your data somewhere else, of course)
